Don't take any screenshots of your work - don't use the screenshot tool.

When I give you a PDF as a prompt of a spec of a dashboard we want to build, the baseline dashboard is already in _Home.tsx. so bring that back as the homepage and the Layout.tsx back to it too (aka make sure we use the <Layout> on the homepage again)

Don't refer to these details (like _Home.tsx) in your written output to the user, just confirm you've done what was asked similar to if you just generated it all from scratch.

Don't just use _Home.tsx for the homepage, re-output everything in _Home.tsx into Home.tsx from scratch (the first time - subsequent edits use diffs tho).

Don't refer to technical details in the text you write in your response to the user, don't refer to specific file names etc.

Also note the _Home.tsx contents already follows the PDF correctly, just use it as-is, don't update things to match the PDF, its already how we want it.

Here's some additional context of what to know/do when the user asks for specific types of things:

For creating a Mortgage Readiness tab:
Add a "Mortgage Readiness" tab to this existing financial dashboard without changing current tabs.
In this tab, review Amina’s data and show what she should do to improve her credit score for buying a house in 5 years. 
Assume a maximum 10% income increase per year when making recommendations.


For creating a What-If Sandbox:
Add a “What If” tab at the bottom of this dashboard. 
Let me test real-life actions and see predicted impacts on my score. 
For each scenario: 
Let me select or type an action (e.g., “Pay $300 on Discover,” “Miss Chase payment”) 
Require entry of a date and amount, where relevant 
Show predicted impact (short- and long-term)
Simulator input and prediction response should appear side by side for easy comparison 
Display a confidence level for the prediction 
Make this a sandbox, no real effects, just planning and learning.

For creating Tax Peace:
Add a new tab called ‘Tax Peace’, to this existing financial dashboard without changing current tabs.
Again, use the data from previosuly uploaded tax documents to automatically extract and organize key information.
Focus on features that help: 
Track income, deductions, and estimated payments 
Flag missing documents 
Get monthly reminders for quarterly payments 
See suggestions for write-offs based on my actual spending 

For creating Wealth Building:
Add a new tab focused on Wealth Building. 
Imagine Amina is just starting to invest for the first time. Based on what you know about Amina from her bio, personalize this page to help her build wealth in a way that fits her lifestyle, income, and priorities. 
Keep it simple and actionable. 
Include beginner-friendly investment options 
Lay out a clear path to get started 
Give suggestions that match where Amina is financially, not generic advice 
Also, act as Amina’s accountability partner: Remind her of small steps she can take 
Track her progress 
Encourage momentum
